\subsubsection*{Motivation}

Model-based testing (MBT) is an  active research field that is currently
evaluated and integrated into industrial verification processes by many
companies. This holds particularly for the embedded and cyber-physical
systems domain. While MBT is applied in different flavours, we consider the
most effective variant to be the one where test cases and concrete test data,
as well as checkers for the expected results~(\emph{test oracles}), are
automatically generated from a reference model:~it guarantees the maximal
return of investment for the time and effort invested into creating the test
model. The test suites generated in this way, however, usually have different
test strength, depending on the generation algorithms applied.

For the safety-critical domain, test suites with guaranteed fault coverage
are of particular interest. For black-box testing, guarantees can be given
only if certain hypotheses are satisfied. These hypotheses are usually
specified by a \emph{fault domain}:~a set of models that may or may not
conform to the SUT. The so-called \emph{complete} test strategies guarantee
to uncover every conformance violation of the SUT with respect to a reference
model, provided that the true SUT behaviour is captured by a member of the
fault domain.

Generation methods for complete test suites have been developed for various
modelling formalisms. In this paper, we use \emph{Communicating Sequential
Processes (CSP)}~\cite{Hoare:1985:CSP:3921,Roscoe2010}; this is a mature
process-algebraic approach that has been shown to be well-suited for the
description of reactive control systems in many publications over almost five
decades. Industrial success has also been reported.

\subsubsection*{Contributions}

This paper presents complete black-box test suites for divergence-free\footnote{The assumption of divergence freedom is usually applied in black-box testing, since it cannot distinguish between divergence and deadlock.} CSP processes interpreted 
both in the trace   and the failures semantics.  
Our results complement work published by two of the authors
in~\cite{DBLP:conf/pts/CavalcantiS17}. There, fault domains are specified as
collections of processes refining a  ``most general'' fault domain member.
With this concept of fault domains, complete test suites may be finite or
infinite. While this gives important insight into the theory of complete test
suites, we are particularly interested in finite suites when it comes to
their practical application.

Therefore,  a complementary approach to the definition of CSP fault
domains is presented in this paper. To this end, we observe that every finite-state CSP
process can be semantically represented as a finite normalised transition
graph, whose edges are labelled by the events the process engages in, and
whose nodes are labelled by minimal acceptances or, alternatively, maximal
refusals~\cite{Roscoe:1994:CME:197600}. The maximal refusals  express the
degree of nondeterminism that is present in a given CSP process state that is
in one-one-correspondence to a node of the normalised transition graph.
Inspired by the way that fault-domains are specified for finite state
machines, we define them here as the set of CSP processes whose
normalised transition graphs do not exceed the size of the reference model's
graph by more than a given constant.

The main contribution of this paper consists in the proof that 
for fault domains of the described type, finite, complete
    test suite generation methods can be given for testing against the conformance relations 
    trace refinement and failures refinement. 
The existence of -- possibly infinite -- complete test suites has been established for process algebras in general and  for CSP in particular by several authors, 
e.g.~\cite{Hennessy:1988:ATP:50497,Schneider:1995:OST:203471.203475,DBLP:conf/fm/PeleskaS96,peleska1997a,DBLP:conf/pts/CavalcantiS17}. To our best knowledge, however, this article is the first to present {\it finite}, complete test suites associated with this class of fault domains and conformance relations.

It should be noted that the presented results are of a theoretical nature: despite being finite, the resulting test suite size will still be too large to be applied in practice to real-world problems.
We discuss a number of promising options how the test suite size can be reduced to become practically applicable.
