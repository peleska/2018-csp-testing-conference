- Model-based testing (MBT) can be performed against CSP reference processes

- For the first time, we provide finite, complete test suites for MBT based on CSP

- The suites serve to check traces refinement and failures refinement

- Completeness means that every conformance violation will be uncovered 

- For the first time, we provide complexity results indicating the number of test executions required to achieve conformance
